# üöÄComparative Analysis of Manual vs Built-in Transform Techniques for Image Watermarking

This notebook presents a comprehensive comparative study of **three major transform-domain techniques**‚Äî**DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)**, **DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)**, and **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**‚Äîfor digital image watermarking. It evaluates both **manual implementations** and **library-based (built-in) functions**, analyzing their behavior in terms of **image fidelity**, **computational efficiency**, and **visual impact**.

## üîç Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Understand the internal workings of transform-based watermarking techniques.
- Implement **manual versions** of DWT, DFT, and DCT using mathematical formulations.
- Compare them against **optimized library implementations** to assess performance and accuracy.
- Quantify results using metrics like **PSNR**, **SSIM**, **RMSE**, and **computation time**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Implemented

### 1. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
- **Manual Implementation**: Uses custom Haar wavelet decomposition for forward and inverse transforms.
- **Built-in Implementation**: Uses `pywt.dwt2()` and `pywt.idwt2()` from the PyWavelets library.
- **Watermark Embedding**: Performed in the **horizontal detail subband (cH)**.

### 2. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- **Manual Implementation**: Computes DFT using matrix multiplications of complex sinusoidal bases.
- **Built-in Implementation**: Uses OpenCV's `cv2.dft()` and `cv2.idft()` functions.
- **Watermark Embedding**: Injected into the **real part** of the **low-frequency components** to maintain image quality.

### 3. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
- **Manual Implementation**: 2D DCT constructed via matrix transformations.
- **Built-in Implementation**: Uses OpenCV‚Äôs `cv2.dct()` and `cv2.idct()` functions.
- **Watermark Embedding**: Inserted into selected **low-frequency DCT coefficients**.

## üñºÔ∏è How It Works

The notebook workflow is structured into distinct phases:

1. **Image Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - Grayscale image is resized and normalized for consistent results.

2. **Transform Applications**:
   - Each transform is applied manually and with built-in functions.
   - Watermark (text pattern) is added in the transform domain.

3. **Inverse Transforms**:
   - Watermarked images are reconstructed using inverse transformations.

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Images are visually compared.
   - Differences are plotted using heatmaps.
   - Metrics are calculated to evaluate fidelity and performance.

5. **Results Summary**:
   - A final table shows all techniques and their results side by side for easy comparison.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

| Metric     | Description                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **PSNR**   | Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio ‚Äî Higher = Better Fidelity |
| **SSIM**   | Structural Similarity Index ‚Äî Higher = Better Similarity |
| **RMSE**   | Root Mean Square Error ‚Äî Lower = Less Distortion     |
| **Time**   | Forward/Inverse transform time in seconds             |

## üìä Key Findings

- **Built-in transforms** are significantly faster due to optimized libraries.
- **Manual methods** provide educational insight into how each transform works.
- **All techniques** preserved acceptable visual fidelity, but:
  - DWT maintained spatial structure better due to localized frequency embedding.
  - DCT showed strong energy compaction, with minimal quality drop.
  - DFT introduced slightly more perceptual distortion when embedding in low-frequency domains.

## üìå Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates the value of transform-domain watermarking and provides a complete comparison between manual and built-in approaches. It is suitable for:

- **Researchers** exploring classical watermarking techniques.
- **Students** learning the internal structure of DCT, DFT, and DWT.
- **Developers** interested in practical image processing applications.

Key takeaways:

- Built-in methods are preferable for deployment due to speed and reliability.
- Manual methods are ideal for understanding the mathematical foundation.
- Each transform domain offers unique trade-offs between quality, robustness, and computational efficiency.
